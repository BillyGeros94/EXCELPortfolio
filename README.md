# Excel Portfolio

Welcome to my Excel Portfolio! This repository showcases a range of projects that demonstrate my expertise in data analysis, visualization, and reporting using Microsoft Excel. Each project covers different datasets and analysis techniques, providing practical insights and solutions for various business needs.

- **Project 1: Data Developer Salary**

    In this project, I created a Data Developer Salary Dashboard to provide insights into salary trends across different categories. I also incorporated slicers based on job title and 
    company location to allow for more interactive filtering. The dashboard visualizes key aspects such as salary distribution by experience level, company size, employment type, and 
    year. 

    Starting with experience level, it's clear that executive roles command the highest salaries, followed by senior-level, mid-level, and entry-level positions. This indicates a direct 
    correlation between experience and compensation, which is expected in most industries but particularly pronounced in data-related roles. The analysis by company size shows that 
    larger companies tend to offer higher salaries compared to medium and small-sized firms. This is likely due to the increased resources, budgets, and demands for data expertise in 
    larger organizations. Interestingly, there is a consistent trend over the years, with average salaries increasing from 2020 to 2023. This could be indicative of the growing 
    importance of data roles and the rising demand for skilled professionals in this field, driving up compensation.

    When looking at employment type, full-time positions offer significantly higher average salaries than part-time, contract, and freelance positions, which typically come with less 
    job security and fewer benefits. This demonstrates the premium companies are willing to pay for full-time, dedicated employees. Additionally, the dashboard also breaks down salary 
    averages per year, reflecting an upward trend. This year-on-year increase highlights the overall growth of the data industry and suggests that it is becoming an even more integral 
    part of business operations, with companies willing to invest more in their data teams.

    Finally, the bottom section of the dashboard shows the yearly average salary per experience level, reinforcing the earlier finding that experience plays a critical role in 
    determining salary. Across all experience levels, there is an upward trend in compensation, particularly for senior and executive roles, which saw the most significant growth. This 
    suggests that as the demand for leadership in data development increases, so too does the willingness of companies to offer competitive salaries to attract top talent.

- **Project 2: Employee Performance Dashboard**

   This project provides a detailed analysis of employee performance by combining data from monthly sales, attendance, and a performance dashboard. The focus is on evaluating how 
   employees across different roles and departments perform relative to sales targets, attendance, and their total contributions to overall sales.

   In terms of sales achievements, John Smith, the Sales Manager, leads with a total of $105,000, consistently exceeding his monthly targets with achievements of 111% in January and 
   115% in February. Michael Brown, the Marketing Executive, also shows strong performance, with $82,000 in total sales, surpassing his targets both months with 103% and 105%. In 
   contrast, the two Sales Executives, Emily Davis and Sara Johnson, performed below expectations. Emily achieved 86% of her target in January but improved to 95% in February. Sara 
   Johnson's sales were consistently below target, achieving 89% in January and 90% in February. Their performance is reflected in the total sales per employee, with Emily contributing 
   $65,000 and Sara $52,000.

   Attendance data plays a key role in explaining these outcomes. John Smith worked all his available days in January and February, correlating with his exceptional sales performance. 
   Michael Brown also had good attendance, working 21 days in January and 22 in February. In contrast, Sara Johnson had the lowest attendance, with 19 days worked in January, which may 
   have contributed to her lower sales performance. The daily sales per employee also show John Smith as the highest performer, generating $4,772.73 daily, while Sara lags behind at 
   $2,736.84 per day.

   The visual dashboard reinforces these findings, showing that the Sales department, which makes up 75% of the workforce, is the primary driver of revenue. Average sales per role 
   indicate that Sales Managers generate the highest average, $52,500, followed by Marketing Executives at $41,000, and Sales Executives at $29,250. The total sales per employee chart 
   further emphasizes John Smithâ€™s outperformance compared to others.

   This project demonstrates how various factors such as attendance, role, and department contribute to individual and team performance. While the Sales department as a whole shows 
   strong results, there are clear areas where performance, particularly among Sales Executives, could be improved with targeted support. The Marketing Executive, despite being the sole 
   representative of the department, displays consistent achievement and adds significant value to the overall team performance.
  
- **Project 3: IMDb Dataset**
  
   This Excel file contained raw and unorganized data from an IMDb movies database. First, I used the appropriate formula to combine all relevant data into a single column and then copied the values to a new sheet. Next, I utilized the Text to Columns feature to split the data into separate columns using the semicolon as a delimiter. After splitting the data, I formatted it into a table with proper headers.

   I then transformed each column to the correct data format, and cleaned and standardized the data to improve readability. This included columns like movie title, release year, genre, country, score, and director. Additionally, I filled in any missing values and corrected inaccurate information, ensuring the dataset was clean and ready for analysis.

- **Project 4: Sports Teams Valuations**

    This dataset was personally scraped using a Python script I developed to gather data on sports teams and their valuations from various Wikipedia pages. The dataset includes key information such as the team name, country, territory, value, revenue, operating income, sport, and league.

    I used pivot tables to manipulate and explore the data, allowing for detailed insights, and created pivot charts for visualization and analysis. The final product was a Sports Teams Valuations Dashboard, featuring line charts that showcase the average team valuation by country and the average operating income by sport. Additionally, the dashboard includes a vertical bar chart illustrating the average team valuation per sport and a horizontal bar chart providing insights into the average revenue by sport. To enhance interactivity, I added slicers for league, country, and territory, allowing for improved filtering and deeper insights into the data.

- **Project 5: Top 100 Companies Analysis**
  
   This dataset includes information on the top 100 companies by revenue, featuring data such as company name, industry, revenue (in million USD), revenue growth, number of employees, and headquarters location. In this project, I first copied the industries column to a new sheet and used the Remove Duplicates feature to keep only the unique values.

   I then applied functions such as SUMIF, COUNTIF, and AVERAGEIF to calculate key metrics, including total revenue per industry, total employees per industry, the number of companies per industry, and the average revenue growth by industry. To enhance data analysis, I employed various types of conditional formatting, including data bars, color scales, and icon sets.

  Finally, I used VLOOKUP on a separate sheet to extract data for selected companies from the main dataset, allowing for a more focused analysis of specific entries.
