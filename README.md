# Excel Portfolio

Welcome to my Excel Portfolio! This repository showcases a range of projects that demonstrate my expertise in data analysis, visualization, and reporting using Microsoft Excel. Each project covers different datasets and analysis techniques, providing practical insights and solutions for various business needs.

- **Project 1: Data Developer**

    In this project, I created a Data Developer Salary Dashboard to provide insights into salary trends across different categories. I also incorporated slicers based on job title and 
    company location to allow for more interactive filtering. The dashboard visualizes key aspects such as salary distribution by experience level, company size, employment type, and 
    year. 

    Starting with experience level, it's clear that executive roles command the highest salaries, followed by senior-level, mid-level, and entry-level positions. This indicates a 
    direct correlation between experience and compensation, which is expected in most industries but particularly pronounced in data-related roles. The analysis by company size shows 
    that larger companies tend to offer higher salaries compared to medium and small-sized firms. This is likely due to the increased resources, budgets, and demands for data expertise 
    in larger organizations. Interestingly, there is a consistent trend over the years, with average salaries increasing from 2020 to 2023. This could be indicative of the growing 
    importance of data roles and the rising demand for skilled professionals in this field, driving up compensation.

    When looking at employment type, full-time positions offer significantly higher average salaries than part-time, contract, and freelance positions, which typically come with less 
    job security and fewer benefits. This demonstrates the premium companies are willing to pay for full-time, dedicated employees. 

    Finally, the bottom section of the dashboard shows the yearly average salary per experience level, reinforcing the earlier finding that experience plays a critical role in 
    determining salary. Across all experience levels, there is an upward trend in compensation, particularly for senior and executive roles, which saw the most significant growth. This 
    suggests that as the demand for leadership in data development increases, so too does the willingness of companies to offer competitive salaries to attract top talent.

- **Project 2: Employee Performance** (to be updated)

   This project provides a detailed analysis of employee performance by combining data from monthly sales, attendance, and a performance dashboard. The focus is on evaluating how 
   employees across different roles and departments perform relative to sales targets, attendance, and their total contributions to overall sales.

   In terms of sales achievements, John Smith, the Sales Manager, leads with a total of $105,000, consistently exceeding his monthly targets with achievements of 111% in January and 
   115% in February. Michael Brown, the Marketing Executive, also shows strong performance, with $82,000 in total sales, surpassing his targets both months with 103% and 105%. In 
   contrast, the two Sales Executives, Emily Davis and Sara Johnson, performed below expectations. Emily achieved 86% of her target in January but improved to 95% in February. Sara 
   Johnson's sales were consistently below target, achieving 89% in January and 90% in February. Their performance is reflected in the total sales per employee, with Emily contributing 
   $65,000 and Sara $52,000.

   Attendance data plays a key role in explaining these outcomes. John Smith worked all his available days in January, correlating with his exceptional sales performance. Michael Brown 
   also had good attendance, working 21 days in January. In contrast, Sara Johnson had the lowest attendance, with 19 days worked in January, which may have contributed to her lower 
   sales performance. The daily sales per employee also show John Smith as the highest performer, generating $4,772.73 daily, while Sara lags behind at $2,736.84 per day.

   The visual dashboard reinforces these findings, showing that the Sales department, which makes up 75% of the workforce, is the primary driver of revenue. Average sales per role 
   indicate that Sales Managers generate the highest average, $52,500, followed by Marketing Executives at $41,000, and Sales Executives at $29,250. The total sales per employee chart 
   further emphasizes John Smith’s outperformance compared to others.

   This project demonstrates how various factors such as attendance, role, and department contribute to individual and team performance. While the Sales department as a whole shows 
   strong results, there are clear areas where performance, particularly among Sales Executives, could be improved with targeted support. The Marketing Executive, despite being the 
   sole representative of the department, displays consistent achievement and adds significant value to the overall team performance.
  
- **Project 3: IMDb**
  
    I began my project by working with the raw data from the "messy_IMDB_dataset" sheet. This initial dataset was disorganized and required significant cleaning to make it usable. I 
    started by consolidating all the data into a single column. This was necessary because the information was scattered and needed to be aligned properly.

    Once I had all the data in one column, I copied it to a new sheet as values. This step was crucial for ensuring that no formatting issues or data links from the original source 
    would interfere with the cleaning process. I then used the "text to columns" feature, selecting the semicolon as the delimiter to split the data into separate columns. This 
    transformation allowed me to structure the data more effectively.

    With the data now divided into columns, I converted it into a table format with headers. This organization made it easier to manage and analyze the data. I addressed any null 
    values by filling them in as appropriate and corrected inaccuracies that I identified. This involved verifying the entries to ensure their correctness and completeness.

    To improve readability, I focused on refining text elements such as titles and director names. I standardized these fields to ensure consistency and clarity throughout the dataset. 
    Additionally, I formatted the columns to align with their respective data types, such as adjusting the date formats and standardizing the presentation of scores.

    The result of this meticulous process is the "clean_IMDB_dataset" sheet. The clean dataset is now well-structured and organized, making it much easier to work with and analyze. By 
    transforming the raw data into a more polished format, I ensured that it is both accurate and accessible for any subsequent analysis or use.

- **Project 4: Sports Teams**

    I created this Sports Teams Valuations Dashboard using data I scraped from various sources. The primary goal of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive view of the 
    financial aspects of different sports leagues and teams, comparing key metrics like team valuations, revenues, and operating income across different countries and sports.

    At the top of the dashboard, I've highlighted the Average Team Valuation per Country. This shows how team valuations vary geographically, with countries like France and Spain 
    showing higher average valuations compared to countries like United States and Italy. Spain, in particular, leads the chart, likely due to less but more valuable list entries

    Next to this, I included the Average Team Valuation per Sport, where American football stands out with significantly higher team valuations compared to other sports like 
    association football (soccer), basketball, and ice hockey. This reflects the financial power of leagues like the NFL, where teams are often valued in the billions.

    To give context to these valuations, I also added a Revenue per Sport bar chart. This shows how American football again leads, generating the highest revenue, which aligns with its 
    high team valuations. Interestingly, basketball and association football generate substantial revenues as well, although their valuations differ depending on the specific teams and 
    leagues. The data provides an interesting comparison, as some sports with lower revenues still maintain relatively high valuations, indicating other financial factors are at play, 
    such as branding and media rights.

    I also wanted to look at profitability, so I included a chart for Average Operating Income per Sport. While American football teams generate high revenues and valuations, it’s 
    their operating income that really sets them apart, with substantial profits compared to other sports. Basketball and ice hockey also show strong profitability, but association 
    football and baseball lag behind in this regard, possibly due to higher operating costs or lower margins.

    At the bottom of the dashboard, I added a detailed chart breaking down Team Valuation by specific teams across different leagues and territories. This allows for more granular 
    analysis, enabling a comparison of individual teams within their respective markets. It also reflects how even within the same sport, there can be significant valuation 
    differences, with some markets and teams having much greater financial influence.

    The filters on the left side of the dashboard allow users to interact with the data, providing the ability to view specific leagues, countries, and territories. This interactivity 
    is crucial because it allows for a focused analysis based on the user’s interest. 

    Overall, this dashboard provides a clear and concise overview of the financial landscape of major sports teams across the globe. It highlights the stark differences in valuation, 
    revenue, and profitability between different sports, countries, and individual teams, offering a valuable tool for anyone interested in the business side of sports.

- **Project 5: Companies**
  
    In this project, I’ve compiled and analyzed data from various companies and industries to understand their financial performance and growth dynamics better. I started with a 
    comprehensive list of top companies, noting their revenue, revenue growth, employee count, and headquarters. For instance, Walmart tops the list with the highest revenue and the 
    largest workforce, reflecting its dominance in the retail sector. Amazon, another major player, also has substantial revenue and a significant number of employees, indicating its 
    strength in both retail and cloud computing. Notably, ExxonMobil and Chevron in the petroleum industry exhibit impressive revenue and growth rates, underscoring the sector's 
    financial clout.

    Next, I analyzed the data by industry, summarizing total revenue, total employees, the number of companies, and average revenue growth for each industry. The use of conditional 
    formatting visually highlights differences across industries. This part of the analysis revealed that the retail and petroleum industries are the largest in terms of revenue. The 
    retail sector not only generates significant revenue but also employs the most people. On the other hand, the infotech sector stands out with its extraordinary growth rate, 
    suggesting rapid expansion and innovation in this area. By looking at the overall industry data, I could see how different sectors compare in terms of revenue and workforce size, 
    with some like automotive and energy showing high growth but lower overall revenue.

    Finally, I focus on showcasing specific company data using a lookup function. It extracts and displays information about selected companies in a visually distinct manner. Each 
    block of information includes the company name, industry, revenue, revenue growth, number of employees, and headquarters location, using different colored boxes to differentiate 
    between companies. For instance, Apple, Tesla, and JPMorgan Chase are among the companies featured here. The purpose of this sheet seems to be to highlight certain companies for 
    quick reference or presentation

    Overall, this project has given me a well-rounded view of how top companies and industries perform. By combining detailed company data with broader industry trends, I can see the 
    key factors driving success and growth in different sectors. This analysis not only helps me understand the financial landscape but also provides insights into how specific 
    companies compare within their industries.

- **Project 6: London**

    In this Excel project, I conducted an analysis of London housing data, focusing on extracting key insights into property prices, sizes, and other relevant features. The dataset 
    covers a wide variety of property types—such as bungalows, duplexes, flats, penthouses, and studios—alongside metrics like price, area in square feet, and the number of bedrooms and 
    bathrooms. To begin, I used descriptive statistics to summarize the key features of the dataset, calculating averages, medians, standard deviations, and minimum and maximum values 
    for important metrics like price, area, and the number of rooms.

    For instance, the average property price across the dataset is approximately £1.86 million, though the range is extremely wide, from £180,000 up to £39.75 million, suggesting a 
    significant disparity between lower-end and ultra-high-end properties. The average property has 3.1 bedrooms and a floor area of around 1,712 square feet, though again the spread is 
    large, with properties ranging from just 274 square feet to over 15,000. These statistics indicate substantial variation in the London property market, where both modest homes and 
    sprawling luxury properties coexist.

    Breaking down the average prices by property type offers additional insight. Bungalows average £904,000, flats or apartments are priced at around £1.25 million, while penthouses 
    stand out with an average price exceeding £3.1 million, making them one of the most expensive property types. In contrast, studios are the most affordable option, averaging 
    £357,500. This analysis reveals how both the size and type of a property significantly influence its value in London’s competitive housing market.

    I also performed an exploratory data analysis using visualizations to better understand the data distribution. The price distribution chart shows a strong right skew, with the 
    majority of properties priced on the lower end and a few outliers with extremely high prices. A scatter plot of price versus area highlights the positive correlation between 
    property size and price, confirming that larger properties tend to be more expensive, though there are some small but highly priced properties, likely due to their location in 
    prestigious areas.

    Further analysis into the relationship between the number of bedrooms and price revealed a similar trend: properties with more bedrooms are generally more expensive, but there are 
    exceptions, where fewer-bedroom homes command high prices due to location or luxury factors. Location data provided additional depth to the analysis, as I could see the distribution 
    of prices across different areas of London. For example, properties in neighborhoods like Mayfair, Belgravia, and Chelsea showed significantly higher price tags, often reaching tens 
    of millions of pounds, highlighting how location is a crucial factor in property valuation.

    In summary, this analysis offers a comprehensive view of the London housing market, characterized by vast diversity in property types, sizes, and prices. The descriptive statistics 
    and visualizations helped uncover key patterns, such as the influence of property type, size, and location on price. These insights reveal the complexity of London’s real estate 
    market, where factors like luxury, location, and property size drive significant variation in prices across different neighborhoods.
